TO DO:
- Create an architecture for services communication
- Handle security in the new architecture from both service-to-service and user-to-service usages
- Split database collections for each microservice
- Create a business function that forces transaction between multiple services (saga pattern)
 Microservices Query for join data:
 - For example we implement an api for getting movies_comments and to join these services we use api composer and api composer joins data in memory and returns it back to gateway to get it to the user.
   so we need to create a third service (composer) that users services discovery to find underlying services and query them.
 Security:
 - For security flow we have user that is either a machine or a person, for both we give them the same access token but for machines we give them full access and permissions.
  another thing is that the endpoint for machine authentication is different from person one, It's uses basic auth for authentication
